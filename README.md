## Utility of a multilevel modelling approach to investigate differences in isolation frequency of Fusarium culmorum in agricultural soil across the Inland Pacific Northwest
This is a repository for a manuscript written for the journal *Phytopathology*. 

#Figure 1

Comparison of raw data collected from the current study (A, C, E) and Backhouse et al., (2004) (B, D, F). Proportion of F. culmorum is out of total Fusarium spp in soil from the current study, and out of total Fusarium spp in wheat from Backhouse et al. (2004). Proportions are plotted against field designation (A, B), average annual precipitation (mm) (C, D), and average annual growing degree days (GDD) (E, F).

#Figure 2

Comparison of model predictions (gray) with empirical data (crosses) using a posterior distribution of offsets for unique quadrats, field, and sampling iterations derived from the dataset. Uncertainty in the posterior distribution is visualized by simulating 100 random samples from the posterior distribution.

#Figure 3

Marginal posterior distributions of field offsets plotted against (A) field sampled, (B) annual precipitation (mm), (C) annual grass reference evapotranspiration, and (D) annual growing degree-days (°C/day). Climate variables are long-term historic means of 38 years from 1980 to 2018. Uncertainty in the posterior distribution is visualized by plotting 1000 samples from the Markov chain used during approximation.

#Figure 4

Correlations between predictor variables in the dataset from the current study (A, B, C) or Backhouse et al. (2004) (D). The correlations are between (A) annual evapotranspiration and annual precipitation, (B) annual growing degree-days and annual precipitation, (C) annual evapotranspiration and annual growing degree days, and (D) annual growing degree-days and annual precipitation. The Pearson correlation coefficient between two predictor variables is denoted using R.

#Figure 5

Predicted proportions of *F. culmorum* out of total *Fusarium* spp. in soil based on (A) annual precipitation or (B) annual evapotranspiration and predicted proportions of *F. culmorum* out of total *Fusarium* spp. in wheat based on (C) annual precipitation or (D) annual growing degree-days using the dataset from Backhouse et al. (2004). Variables used were annual precipitation (P), annual evapotranspiration (E), and annual growing degree days (G). Letters in each sub-plot indicate which climate variables were used in the model equation and “^2” and “\*” denote a quadratic and interaction parameter, respectively. Each line represents the impact of the climate variable by simulating a new proportion of F. culmorum using the posterior distribution of each multilevel model. Variation among sampled fields, quadrats, and iterations is visualized by plotting 100 simulated proportions of F. culmorum.
